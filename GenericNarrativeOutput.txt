Project Overview:

Project Name: Ljosra

Nature of the Project:
-  Type: Decentralized platform for climate-positive infrastructure
- Functionality: Ocean wave energy generation, carbon capture, blockchain-based transparency and traceability
- Intended Users: Communities, investors, ecological contributors, data validators
- Value Proposition: Empowerment to fund clean energy and carbon removal, earn tokens through ecological contributions
- Business Model: Revenue from energy generation, carbon credits, and ecological data validation

Blockchain Infrastructure Recommendation:
- Suggested Blockchain: Ethereum or a Layer 2 solution for scalability and lower transaction costs, ensuring high security and established ecosystem support.
- Governance Design: DAO-based, emphasizing ecological contributions over token holdings to drive decision-making.

Token Role within Ecosystem:

- Token Classification: Hybrid (Utility and Governance)
- Utility Functions:
- Rewarding contributions to energy generation and carbon sequestration
- Incentivizing data validation
- Facilitating governance participation based on ecological impact

Tokenomics Architecture:

1. Total Supply: 1,000,000,000 tokens

2. Token Allocation Plan:
   - Community and User Incentives: 30%
   - Ecological Contributors and Validators: 25%
   - Development and Infrastructure: 20%
   - Team and Advisors: 10%
   - Reserve and Ecosystem Growth: 10%
   - Initial Public Sale: 5%

   Reasoning:
   - A large portion is allocated to community and user incentives to drive engagement and ecological contributions, reflecting a model similar to Render (RNDR) which prioritizes rewarding operational roles.
   - Development and Infrastructure allocation ensures ongoing platform improvements and innovations, akin to practices seen in projects like The Graph (GRT).
   - A smaller portion is set for public sale to maintain a controlled entry into the market, facilitating regulatory compliance and stable growth.

3. Vesting Strategy:
   - Team and Advisors: 4-year vesting with a 1-year cliff
   - Development and Infrastructure: Released based on project milestones
   - Ecological Contributors and Validators: Continuous distribution based on contributions

   Reasoning: Aligns incentives with long-term project growth and sustainability, ensuring commitment from the core team and contributors.  

4. Utility Mechanisms:
   - Staking: Participants can stake tokens to earn rewards, promoting network security and active participation.
   - Rewards: Tokens distributed based on energy generation, carbon sequestration, and data validation contributions.
   - Fee Participation: A portion of platform fees (e.g., from energy sales) is redistributed to token holders, enhancing token value.      

Governance Structure:

- Proposal Submission: Any DAO member can submit proposals, but prioritization is determined by ecological impact scores.
- Voting: Weighted by ecological contributions rather than token holdings to ensure decisions benefit the ecosystem.
- Progressive Decentralization: Initial oversight by the core team with a gradual transition to community-driven governance over two years. 

Value Accrual Mechanisms:

- Demand Generation: Driven by the need for tokens to participate in staking, governance, and ecological contributions.
- Value Capture: Tokens accrue value through platform fees and increased demand for energy and carbon credits.
- Inflation Control: Token release through rewards is tied to ecological impact, preventing dilution without corresponding utility.

Phased Launch Strategy:

1. Initial Distribution:
   - Conduct a controlled public sale for initial liquidity.
   - Distribute tokens to early ecological contributors and validators.

2. Community Growth:
   - Launch incentives for community engagement and ecological contributions.
   - Foster partnerships with environmental organizations.

3. Governance Activation:
   - Establish the DAO framework and initiate the first community-led proposals.
   - Transition governance to community control based on readiness.

4. Ecosystem Expansion:
   - Expand energy generation and carbon capture projects.
   - Integrate additional blockchain-based transparency features for broader adoption.

Design Principles:

- Reflects patterns from successful projects like Render (RNDR) and The Graph (GRT) in terms of rewarding operational roles and ensuring sustainability.
- Prioritizes long-term sustainability with clear, necessary utility and regulatory awareness.
- Maintains fair and transparent distribution aligned with stakeholder interests.
